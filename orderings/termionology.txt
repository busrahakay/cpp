strict weak order

irreflexive: for all x, x R x is false

transitive: for all a, b and c, if r(a, b) and r(b, c) are both true then r(a, c) is true;

let e(a, b) be !r(a, b) && !r(b, a), then e is transitive: e(a, b) && e(b, c) implies e(a, c).
Under these conditions, it can be shown that e is an equivalence relation, and r induces a strict total ordering on the equivalence classes determined by e.


Irreflexivity	f(x, x) must be false.
Antisymmetry	f(x, y) implies !f(y, x)
Transitivity	f(x, y) and f(y, z) imply f(x, z).
Transitivity of equivalence	Equivalence (as defined above) is transitive: if x is equivalent to y and y is equivalent to z, then x is equivalent to z. (This implies that equivalence does in fact satisfy the mathematical definition of an equivalence relation.) [1]

Two objects x and y are equivalent if both f(x, y) and f(y, x) are false. Note that an object is always (by the irreflexivity invariant) equivalent to itself.
