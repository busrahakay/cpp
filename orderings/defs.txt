# Equivalent vs unordered vs incomparable

Equivalence is a binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric and
transitive.

# Strict weak ordering

It's a partial ordering in which incomparability is transitive.

* irreflexiv: x R x is false

* antisymmetric: if x R y is true, then y R x is false

* transitive: if x R y and y R z are true, then x R z is true

* transitive incomparability: if x and y are incomparable
  (R-incomparable), and so y and z are, then so x and z are
