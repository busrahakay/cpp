Check the overhead introduced by the move semantics using a simple
structure A that has a pointer to an integer.  We compare two cases:

* The baseline case: we implement the swapping of values of two
objects by directly manipulating (swapping) the pointer fields in the
objects.

* The move semantics case: we implement the swapping with the move
  semantics.

Question: does the move semantics introduce some overhead?  You can
examine the assembly code or take time measurements.
