Write a function template "bubble" that implements bubble sort, so
that I can sort in ascending order:

int t[] = {3, 1, 2};
bubble(begin(t), end(t));

vector v = {10, 5, 1};
bubble(begin(v), end(v))

Next, let a user pass a callable that compares elements to allow for
sorting in descending order:

bubble(begin(v), end(v), std::greater<int>{});

Add a default callable so that the third function argument doesn't
have to be provided.
