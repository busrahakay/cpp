Implement function my_make_unique<A>(<arg>) that creates on the heap
an object of type A by perfectly passing to it the one <arg>.  Next,
the function passes the created object to unique_ptr<A> for
management, and then returns by value the managing object.  Please
overload the constructors of A, and make sure the right constructor is
called.
