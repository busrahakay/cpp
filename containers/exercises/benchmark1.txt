Write a benchmark that would measure the time taken to:

* create a container of 10^8 integers initialized with the consecutive
  values starting from 0 by inserting an element at the front,

* calculate the sum of all elements of the container,

* empty the container by repeatedly erasing the first element.

Measure the times for a vector, deque, list and forward_list.

For a vector and a deque, the above creation is severly inefficient.
Instead, we should first reserve memory for the elements with the
"reserve" function, and then set the values,
