Type aliases cannot be specialized.  Use type traits.

Template introduction:

* the example with sorting:

  - sort a vector, an array, a deque,

  - try to sort a list: error, because a list doesn't offer a random
    access iterator,

  - use the function std::begin, and std::end, because then we can
    take iterators to C arrays,
