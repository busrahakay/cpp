Implement a suffic increment operator for std::string that modifies
the string to create the next permutation (hint: use
std::next_permutation), so that we can use it to produce all
permutations of a string that has its characters sorted:

cout << "Permutations for abc:" << endl;
  for(string i = "abc"; i++ != "cba";)
    cout << i << endl;
