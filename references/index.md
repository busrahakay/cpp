# Introduction

C++ references are like no references of other languages, because at
run-time they might not exists (that can be optimized out at the
compile-time).

In languages like Java or C#, references are pointers with
shared-ownership semantics (i.e., a reference can be copied, and the
object exists as long as at least one reference exists), and with the
object member selection syntax (i.e., `object.member`, instead of
`pointer->member`).
