This is a counter example of when not to use references.  It's also a
good example to discuss categories.

Implement type "matrix" that implements a neighborhood matrix for
dense (that have many edges) undirected (edges are undirected) graphs.
The implementation can use vector<bool>.

To initialize a matrix that represents a graph of n vertexes without
edges:

matrix m(n);

Access an edge from vertex i to vertex j:

m(i, j)

We can use m(i, j) to either:

* check whether an edge exists: assert(m(i, j) == true)

* to add an edge: m(i, j) == true;

This graph:

   (1)
   / \
  /   \
(0)   (3)
  \   /
   \ /
   (2)

Is represented by the neighborhood matrix:

0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1
0 1 1 0
